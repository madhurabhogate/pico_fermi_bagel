**P**ico   **F**ermi   **B**agel

The object of the game is to guess a 3 digit number correctly.

**Pico (P)** means a digit is correct but it’s in the wrong place value or location.

**Fermi (F)** means a digit is correct AND it’s in the correct place value or location.

**Bagels (B)** means nothing is correct.

_Fun facts:_

_“pico”_ means “a little” so when you get a pico in the game, it means you’re a little bit right.

_“Fermi”_ is the name of a famous Italian mathematician so when you get a Fermi in the game,
you’re thinking like a mathematician and getting very close.

_“bagels”_, What does a bagel look like? A zero! it means you got zero correct.

Example:
Say the number you want to guess is '629'
```
